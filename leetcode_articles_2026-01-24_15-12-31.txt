Hi everyone,

I have around 4 years of experience working in a Support / Production Support role (L2/L3). During this time, I’ve been actively involved in:

1. Debugging production issues

2. Root cause analysis

3. Writing SQL queries / scripts for data fixes and automation

4. Working closely with development teams

I am now preparing seriously for SDE roles and practicing DSA on LeetCode with the goal of applying to MAANG / top product companies.

My question is:

1. Will my 4 years in a support role be viewed as a “gap” or a disadvantage when applying for SDE roles?

2. Is it common for people from support backgrounds to transition into SDE roles at these companies?

3. Any advice on how to best position this experience while applying?

I’d really appreciate insights from people who have made a similar transition or have experience with MAANG hiring.

Thanks in advance!

Hi everyone, i had an amazon OA today, received two questions for coding test.
You are given a binary string S consisting only of '0' and '1'.

You build a new string finalS using the following operation:

Start with an empty string finalS= ""

For each character c in shipmentData (from left to right):

push c in finalS, reverse finalS.


Your task is to rearrange the characters of shipmentData (you may reorder it arbitrarily) such that the resulting finalSequence is lexicographically maximum.

Return the rearranged shipmentData that produces this maximum finalSequence. 

Can anyone come up with the solution as i was not able to pass all the test cases. Would be great if someone gives me tips to prepare for OA rounds man, i have solved a lot of leetcode questions but never came across such question before

Hi Community,
I recently gone through 2 rounds for google.
Googlyness and Virtual Coding round, if I got a positive feedback I will get chance for 2 more onsite rounds.

I would like your opinions on my performance.

Googlyness - It went smooth, I answered everything and interviewer also seemed okay with that, he asked only 5 questions to me and round got over in 25 mins.
If I ignore the early end of the interview I would rate (Lean Hire / Hire).

Coding round - I was asked a question for which I was able to comeup with the approach within 5 mins and interviewer was ok with it, then she came up with a follow up I answered that also. After that I asked should I code it up, but then I was asked 2 more follow ups.
And discussing the Questions + 3 follow ups + pseudo code the time was over. I asked her I was not able to code the solution she said - No problem we look more for the approach and thought process in candidates.
If I ignore the part that I was not able to code, I'd rate my self (Strong Hire/ Hire).

I would love your opinions on my performance and would I get the onsite opportunity ?

###### While practicing graph problems, I realized that many times I was choosing DFS or BFS randomly, without thinking about why that approach.
###### What helped me was focusing on what the problem was actually asking.
###### I found that if I only needed to check whether a path exists, a DFS Approach was usually enough. But was the problem asked for the shortest path or minimum steps, BFS was the better choice because it explores level by level traversals.

###### This conclusion helped me stop forcefully using DFS in problems where BFS was more appropriate and made my solutions less complicated.

Hope this would help someone ⚡✨ and would save lots of time in deciding DFS/BFS.
